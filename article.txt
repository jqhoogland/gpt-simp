Banach spaces are a type of vector space, which are collections of objects (called vectors) that can be added together and multiplied by scalars (constant numbers). A Banach space is a type of vector space that has a metric, which is a way of measuring the distance between two vectors, and is complete, which means that any sequence of vectors in the space will eventually reach a limit. Banach spaces are named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach who introduced this concept in 1920-1922 with Hans Hahn and Eduard Helly. Maurice René Fréchet was the first to use the term "Banach space" and Banach in turn then coined the term "Fréchet space". Banach spaces were originally studied by Hilbert, Fréchet, and Riesz as a way of studying function spaces. Banach spaces are used in functional analysis and other areas of analysis.
