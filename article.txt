A Banach space is a type of mathematical space which is complete and normed. This means that it has a metric which allows us to measure the length and distance between vectors, and it is complete in the sense that a sequence of vectors will always have a limit, or end point, that is within the space. It is named after Polish mathematician Stefan Banach who introduced and studied it in the 1920s. Before this, Banach spaces were studied as function spaces by Hilbert, Fr√©chet, and Riesz. Banach spaces are very important for functional analysis and are often used in other parts of analysis.
